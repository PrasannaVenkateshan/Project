1,30.2,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,0,false,opens the face as he waits on the short ball outside off  but he is not quite able to beat backward point. The slowness of the pitch means those shots don't have the greatest chance of coming off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,131.807

1,30.4,KAJ Roach,AT Rayudu,2,false,dropped! But gee  this is so tough. Especially for a debutant. Obed McCoy runs to his left from mid-off  reaching out his dominant hand  but it just doesn't stick.

Now he's in the firing line as Rayudu goes for a free-flowing drive over the top. The timing is spot on  the placement is nearly spot on too.

1,30.5,KAJ Roach,AT Rayudu,0,false,doesn't quite rise up as much as he'd like and so has to adjust midway through playing the pull shot. Looks entirely awkward tickling the ball off his knees to midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,130.944

1,31.1,D Bishoo,V Kohli,1,false,checks his shot  which suggests he is done in by the pitch.

1,31.2,D Bishoo,AT Rayudu,2,false,short and outside off  Rayudu leaps back and carves it to the left of the sweeper,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,85.203

1,32.2,AR Nurse,AT Rayudu,0,true,swings all across the line and loses his middle stump. Earlier in the innings  he was playing balls like these - tossed up outside off - through the covers. Here  in the search of quick runs  he goes for a slog sweep and the slower pace from Nurse does him in completely. Good  composed half-century from Rayudu  at a time when India are searching for a long-term No. 4,non-home run,bowled,,no extra,92.175
1,32.3,AR Nurse,MS Dhoni,1,false,rocks back and crunches the short ball to long-on,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,86.341

1,34.1,AR Nurse,V Kohli,1,false,he's doin it in singles  this one manufactured by stretching to the pitch of the offbreak outside off and closing the bat face to target long-on. Seven runs away from 10 000,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,92.183

1,36.3,AR Nurse,V Kohli,1,false,a simple tip over to long-on takes the Indian captain to 10 000 ODI runs! He raises his arms to the sky  then kisses his ring finger  a salute to his wife  and then looks back at Dhoni with a cheeky old grin. Insane numbers for Kohli - he beats Tendulkar's record by a whopping 54 innings and becomes the fastest man to 10 000 ODI runs. The pace at which he churns out runs is unbelievable. The discipline that he has to cut out all kinds of risk from his game  that computer in his head that decides which way the bat should turn to pick the gap - all of that has been on show in this innings,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,96.775

1,37.2,MN Samuels,V Kohli,1,false,steps out of his crease and drives ot long-on. As he gets to the other end  Samuels congratulates Kohli for 10 000. Incidentally  Samuels was around when Tendulkar scored his 10 000 too  seven years ago,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,87.156

1,38.5,AR Nurse,MS Dhoni,0,false,full and slow and outside off. Dhoni tries to tickle it into the leg side  but gets struck on the pad.

1,40.1,OC McCoy,V Kohli,1,false,slower ball  almost a yorker on leg stump. Clipped off his boots to deep backward square,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,129.021
1,40.2,OC McCoy,MS Dhoni,0,true,through him! Debut wicket for McCoy  and what a scalp! Slower ball  length on off  and going through the batsman's defense. Too close to Dhoni's body  and it's gone between bat and pad. Takes the top of off stump  and now it's time for Rishabh Pant,non-home run,bowled,,no extra,114.259
1,40.3,OC McCoy,RR Pant,0,false,good length outside off stump  and defended off the back foot for his first delivery,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,

1,41.3,MN Samuels,V Kohli,1,false,length ball turning inwards  and flicked off his hips to deep midwicket with ease,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,88.767
1,41.4,MN Samuels,RR Pant,2,false,full on middle  and knocked off his pads to the vacant square-leg region. Enough time to jog back for the second,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,86.539
1,41.5,MN Samuels,RR Pant,0,false,full just outside off  and defended with the turn to cover,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,
1,41.6,MN Samuels,RR Pant,1,false,length ball  wide outside off  and cut off the backfoot to deep point. He'll keep strike,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,
1,42.1,OC McCoy,RR Pant,4,false,full outside off  and he walks towards the ball's pitch  and crunches a cover drive through the infield! First boundary in ODI cricket for Pant,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,129.681
1,42.2,OC McCoy,RR Pant,2,false,slower ball  full outside off  and Pant slogs across the line to chip a shot to the left of long on. Lucky,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,112.290
1,42.3,OC McCoy,RR Pant,4,false,full outside off stump  and Pant waits for the ball to come to him  before nonchalantly lifting the ball right over the bowler's head! Flat-batted  and almost all the way,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,111.985
1,42.4,OC McCoy,RR Pant,1,false,slower ball  wide outside off stump  and rolling into the keeper's gloves. Left alone by Pant,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,wide,105.087

1,43.2,MN Samuels,V Kohli,1,false,calmly deposits the full delivery on off stump at long-on's hands. Kohli is looking for two  but Pant yells no  and it's the right call,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,90.196
1,43.3,MN Samuels,RR Pant,0,true,swings all across the line and gets pinned in front of middle. Umpire Nandan raises the finger but Pant reviews. He was done in by the slower pace. And it doesn't bounce as high for the cross-bat shot. Unless there's a nick here  he will have to go  and he will be burning a review as well. UltraEdge shows no bat and ball-tracking says three reds. Yer outta here,non-home run,leg before wicket,,no extra,91.522
1,43.4,MN Samuels,RA Jadeja,1,false,pulls the short ball away to long-on,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,85.971
1,43.5,MN Samuels,V Kohli,4,false,creams it to the cover boundary and celebrates back-to-back hundreds - he's done that seven times over his career now! That's 14 ODI hundreds. For context  Rahul Dravid only ever made 12 in all the time he played for India. Overall  it's century no. 37. It's also century no. 30 at No. 3 - taking him past another bonafide legend - Ricky Ponting. His celebration was pretty cool too - pointed at his bat and made the hand-signal  for 'talking'. Bat doing the talking.,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,
1,43.6,MN Samuels,V Kohli,1,false,works it away through midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,90.611

1,44.4,KAJ Roach,RA Jadeja,1,false,full and outside off  Jadeja wafts at it and gets a thick outside edge to deep third man. He seems to get a bit greedy after that  running back for a second run with Kohli yelling no. Lucky for India that he's ridiculously quick. Makes his ground easily,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,132.097
1,44.5,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,1,false,pulls the short ball away over midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,128.685

1,45.1,MN Samuels,RA Jadeja,2,false,goes back and flicks a good length ball in all the acres of space on the leg side. Everyone's on the boundary so Jadeja pinches two by playing with soft hands,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,77.569
1,45.2,MN Samuels,RA Jadeja,1,false,shortish and outside off  slashes it to the sweeper cover,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,91.782
1,45.3,MN Samuels,V Kohli,1,false,a shade short and Kohli is back in his crease  hammering it to long-on,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,76.120
1,45.4,MN Samuels,RA Jadeja,1,false,full and outside off  drives to long-off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,88.496

1,46.2,OC McCoy,V Kohli,6,false,gets past 1000 runs in 2018 - and it comes off a rip-roaring six straight down the ground. That  by the way  breaks another record - fastest to aggregate 1000 in a calendar year - it's only taken him 11 innings. Take a back seat  Hashim Amla circa 2010 and Kohli circa 2012 (15 innings),home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,128.022
1,46.3,OC McCoy,V Kohli,2,false,comes down the track  the left-arm quick goes short and slow  Kohli responds with a pull  and the fielder at short fine leg mucks it up. Chandrapaul Hemraj the culprit,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,111.611
1,46.4,OC McCoy,V Kohli,6,false,pitched-up and it's smashed over the top again  the ball sailing into the delirious crowd behind long-on. Kohli's bat isn't so much talking now as it's singing an Aria in C major. If that doesn't make sense  it's intentional  cause his batting doesn't make any sense,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,110.177
1,46.5,OC McCoy,V Kohli,1,false,back of a length and outside off  steers it behind point,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.487
1,46.6,OC McCoy,RA Jadeja,2,false,full and outside off  guides it to third man for a quick single  and once there's the overthrow  Kohli agrees to a second as well,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.914
1,47.1,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,6,false,what a catch - by the ball boy outside the boundary. He's the only one in play as soon as this ball became a half-volley outside off stump. Kohli leans into the drive  extends his hands  and there's timing to spare,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,129.871
1,47.2,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,4,false,even wide yorkers aren't working. The funny thing is  Kohli doesn't even look like he has the strength to stay standing  but somehow when the ball is delivered  he has the perfect counter ready. A squeeze to the third man boundary,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.572
1,47.3,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,1,false,full and outside off  drives smoothly to point,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,134.131
1,47.4,KAJ Roach,RA Jadeja,1,false,yorker a shade outside off  Jadeja jams an angled bat down to secure a single behind point,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,132.323
1,47.5,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,2,false,full toss outside off  Kohli places it to the left of long-off for a couple,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.518
1,47.6,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,4,false,pulverises this full toss though  again only extending the arms while playing a text-book cover drive and picking up a boundary. That's how you capitalise on the bowler's mistake. It doesn't take a lot of effort. Just clarity in the mind. India go past 300  btw,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,136.554
1,48.1,OC McCoy,RA Jadeja,1,false,inside edge as he goes swinging after a very full delivery on off stump. Single to long leg,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.899
1,48.2,OC McCoy,V Kohli,1,false,lifts an overpitched delivery to long-off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,134.445
1,48.3,OC McCoy,RA Jadeja,1,false,gets struck on the pad off a full toss and so instead of the boundary he was looking for  behind square leg  he'll have to settle for a single in the covers,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,leg bye,137.472
1,48.4,OC McCoy,V Kohli,1,false,launches a back of a length delivery out to deep midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.918
1,48.5,OC McCoy,RA Jadeja,0,true,taken at long-on! And it's a steepler as well. Good work from Kieran Powell. He's on the boundary edge. He tracks it all the way  settles under it  and Jadeja perishes in pursuit of quick runs. Big heave against a slower ball outside off and that lack of pace does him in,non-home run,caught,KOA Powell,no extra,131.395
1,48.6,OC McCoy,V Kohli,1,false,full and outside off  Kohli steers it to point,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,107.387
1,49.1,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,0,false,full and outside off  drives it smoothly to long-off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.644
1,49.2,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,4,false,scoops a ball two feet wide of off stump and finds the boundary at fine leg. Yep. Physics don't apply to Kohli now.,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,132.124
1,49.3,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,2,false,wide yorker  which Kohli slices to deep point and immediately looks for two. He's running on empty but he wants the strike back. He wants more runs. For himself and for India. Puts in the dive to beat the throw from the deep and stays there for a good three seconds  taking deep breaths  before he comes up and celebrates 150,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,130.743
1,49.4,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,6,false,launches it over long-on! There's a fielder there but to Kohli he may as well be a hologram. Makes the ball soar over his outstretched right hand,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,131.659
1,49.5,KAJ Roach,V Kohli,1,false,full and outside off  he slaps it over the covers,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.676
1,49.6,KAJ Roach,Mohammed Shami,0,false,beats him with a wide yorker and that's the end of the innings.,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.999
2,0.1,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,1,false,sweet sound off the middle of the bat as Powell flicks the short ball to mid-on.,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,144.180
2,0.2,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,1,false,targets the body and Hemraj is able to shuffle over to off stump and work it away to long leg,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.623
2,0.3,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,4,false,more evidence of how batting against the new ball could be quite profitable. It comes onto the bat so well and Powell  knowing this  plays a neat little flick  concentrating solely on placing the ball past midwicket,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,139.200
2,0.4,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,false,good length on middle  Powell turns it to midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.667
2,0.5,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,false,bouncer on middle and leg  Powell goes for a pull but it just zips past him,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.172
2,0.6,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,false,good length on off stump  defends,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,133.622
2,1.1,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,1,false,targets the stumps - that's his specialty - and Hemraj just about manages to whip it away behind square leg,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.055
2,1.2,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,0,false,shortish and outside off  chops it to point,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.360
2,1.3,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,0,false,fuller delivery outside off  Powell presents the full face to it,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.512

2,1.5,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,0,false,drives on the up to cover,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.288
2,1.6,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,0,false,yorker outside off  Powell is just a touch late to get his bat down,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.712
2,2.1,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,0,false,opens the face as he gets forward to a short of a length ball outside off. Can't beat point though,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.413
2,2.2,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,0,false,leaves the good length ball outside off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.127
2,2.3,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,0,false,full and swinging outside the off stump. Hemraj doesn't quite fancy it.,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,130.836
2,2.4,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,1,false,pulls the short ball on leg stump down to long leg  with the front foot off the ground. Glorious!,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,141.296
2,2.5,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,false,stays in line with a shortish delivery on off stump,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.198
2,2.6,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,4,false,picks up the length ball and hammers it over wide long-on. Outstanding strokeplay. Don't need to move the feet for that. Just keep the eye on the ball and swing that big ole bat,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.464
2,3.1,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,0,false,works a back of a length ball away past midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,141.036
2,3.2,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,4,false,they like this length India are bowling. Just short of a length. It's sitting up on the pitch to be tonked across the line. Four through midwicket,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.696
2,3.3,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,1,false,outside edge zips past the diving Dhoni. Moves to his left  but the ball has a little too much pace on it  pitches just before it reaches him  flicks his webbing and then flies away,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,144.213
2,3.4,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,4,false,magnificent hitting! Powell looks outrageously good when he's just standing  and delivering. Gets up on his toes and pulls the short ball away with elegance to spare,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,141.579
2,3.5,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,0,false,full on off stump  blocks,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.302
2,3.6,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,1,false,works the length ball off his pads to deep square leg,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.604
2,4.1,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,false,outside edge as Powell is made to play with a straight bat whilst the ball is angled across him. That's his weakness - he looks tentative; drawn into playing away from his body. Still  India don't have any slips and the ball wanders out to short third man,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,129.369
2,4.2,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,2,false,comes out of his crease to pull the short ball away. There's protection out at deep square leg now,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.147
2,4.3,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,1,false,dabs the shortish delivery outside off  looking for a boundary to third man  but India have Kuldeep there  at a very very deep second slip position  specifically to stop the outside edge from yielding runs. Still gets West Indies one though  so it's entirely weird,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,136.128
2,4.4,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,0,false,back of a length on off stump  defends,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,144.760
2,4.5,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,0,false,slower delivery on and around leg stump  Hemraj flicks towards midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,125.672
2,4.6,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,1,false,pulls the short ball away to long leg - again that front leg rising up off the ground  adding extra oomph to the shot,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,135.286
2,5.1,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,1,false,he looks dodgy on the front foot - it moves after he plays the shot  and here that means his cover drive turns into an inside edge to mid-on,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.209
2,5.2,UT Yadav,KOA Powell,1,false,back of a length on off stump  nudges it to long-on,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.682
2,5.3,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,4,false,dismisses it to the long leg boundary  the ball straying onto his pads and his wrists accepting the gift with glee,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.809
2,5.4,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,4,false,launched over point now. It's a full toss outside off and the left-hander can't believe his luck even as he reaches his bat out and angles it like a ramp,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,144.007
2,5.5,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,0,false,good length on off stump  defends,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.232
2,5.6,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,0,false,fuller delivery outside off  drives to mid-off,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.578
2,6.1,Mohammed Shami,KOA Powell,0,true,taken at deep midwicket. Powell's good on the pull and he is forced to play that shot - Shami adjusting to the batsman stepping out of his crease and cramping the left-hander for room. Should Powell have gone through with an aggressive shot? The new ball is the best chance to score runs on this slow pitch so perhaps he can be given a little leeway. But at this level  and so early in the innings  you shouldn't be picking the deep fielders out. After all  in the first 10  there can be only two out there and if you're giving catching practice to them  then there's something seriously wrong,non-home run,caught,RR Pant,no extra,128.976
2,6.2,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,0,false,good length  outside off  leaves it alone,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,139.580
2,6.3,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,0,false,back of a length on off stump  defends  but only off the inside edge,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.111
2,6.4,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,2,false,gorgeous shot - he's off the ground  the ball is still getting big on him  but somehow Hope is able to flick it ever so sweetly to the backward square leg boundary. Would have clanged into the advertising triangles if not for Kuldeep diving to his right,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,142.744
2,6.5,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,0,false,good length on off stump  defends,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,144.880
2,6.6,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,4,false,oh  this is blockbuster batting. Hope is met with another decent delivery - on a good length outside off - but he treats it so cruelly  thumping it on the up and placing it beating Kohli on his left at mid-off,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,128.300
2,7.1,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,4,false,he's reaching away from his body  feet going nowhere  but despite all those flaws  he gets a boundary through a thick outside edge that beats Shami at short third man,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,140.356
2,7.2,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,4,false,smacks it straight down the ground - as if he's worried about how he's looking at the crease right now and wanted to show the world that he's much better. Short stride forward  extension of defence  fine timing,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,138.423
2,7.3,UT Yadav,C Hemraj,1,false,short ball on middle  Hemraj pulls to deep midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,136.292
2,7.4,UT Yadav,SD Hope,0,false,jaffa! It hits the seam a shade outside off and straightens away from the angle. And poor Hope  playing for that angle  is comfortably beaten,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,143.916
2,7.5,UT Yadav,SD Hope,0,false,good length on off stump  defends,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.705
2,7.6,UT Yadav,SD Hope,4,false,crunches it through the covers! Hope is playing shots that sound so sweet and look so good. Standing tall behind a back of a length delivery and using the vertical bat to great effect,home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,137.217
2,8.1,Mohammed Shami,C Hemraj,1,false,whips it off his pads to deep midwicket,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,131.528
2,8.2,Mohammed Shami,SD Hope,0,false,shapes to pull the short ball outside off  but realises it's got too much height on it and so bails out,non-home run,no wicket,no wicket,no extra,136.184

2,9.3,Kuldeep Yadav,C Hemraj,0,true,ripper! And yet Kuldeep doesn't do any more than present a googly in line with the stumps. Everything else is on the batsman. Hemraj doesn't pick it.
